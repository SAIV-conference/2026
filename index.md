Formal reasoning about learning systems presents novel, challenging, and exciting problems, including but not limited to the verification of neural networks and the development of safeguards for machine learning algorithms. The Symposium on AI Verification brings together researchers from the fields of formal methods and artificial intelligence, providing a platform for the exchange of ideas and cross-pollination of insights on these critical areas.

SAIV 2026 will be co-located with the [Federated Logic Conference](https://www.floc26.org/) in Lisbon, Portugal.

SAIV 2026 will host the 7th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP'26).
